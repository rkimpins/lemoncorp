		<h1>Metrics, or how we measure distance</h1>
		<h2>Rigorous Definition</h2>
		<p>So what is a metric? Let's start with the axiomatic definition, and build from there</p>

		From Wikipedia: 
		<blockquote>
		A metric on a set X is a function (called distance function or simply distance)

			d : X × X → [0, ∞)

		where [0, ∞) is the set of non-negative real numbers
		and for all x , y , z ∈ X the following three axioms are satisfied:
		<ol>
			<li>d(x, y) = 0 ⇔ x = y     identity of indiscernibles</li>
			<li>d(x, y) = d(y, x)       symmetry</li>
			<li>d(x, y) ≤ d(x, z) + d(z, y)       triangle inequality</li>
		</ol>
		</blockquote>
		<h2>What does this mean?</h2>
		<h3>Identity of indescernibles</h3>
		<p>
			If two points are 0 distance apart, they are in fact the same point. Also, if two 
			points are equal, then they must be 0 distance apart
		</p>
		<h3>symmetry</h3>
		<p>
			The distance from our first point to our second point must be equal to the distance 
			from our second point to our first point. Distance doesn't change when we swap the 
			direction we are going in
		</p>
		<h3>triangle inequality</h3>
		<p>
			If we are travelling from point A to point B, we have a certain distance between them.
			If we instead choose to take a detour and go from point A to point C and then from point C to
			point B, the distance must be greater than or equal to our original distance.
		</p>
		<h2>Euclidean distance / Straight-line distance</h2>
		<p>
			Euclidean distance is what most people think of when they think about measuring distance.
			It is called straight-line distance because you can imagine place a ruler between the two
			points and using that as the measure of distance.
			<br/>[PICTURE OF 2 BY 1 GRAPH]<br/>
			In the graph above, if we measure the length of the line between the points with a ruler, 
			we would get the euclidean distance. In this case, it is \sqrt{5}. How did we get this though?
			Well, we use our old friend a^2 + b^2 = c^2
			a^2 + b^2 = c^2 -> 1^2 + 2^2 = c^2 -> 5 = c^2 -> c = \sqrt{5}
			The general formula given two points A and B is:
			<blockquote>
				d(Point_1, Point_2) = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
			</blockquote>
		</p>
		<h2>A brief note on higher dimensions</h2>
		<p>
			We won't always be working in 2D. It is pretty common to need to find distances in 3D, 
			and we can actually extend the definition of a metric to higher dimensions. For the Euclidean
			distance, we get something like the following formula
			<blockquote>
				d(p,q) = \sqrt{\sum^n_{i=0} (p_i - q_i)^2}
			</blockquote>
			Now you can find the euclidean metric in an n-dimensional cartesian space. Is this helpful?
			Not sure, but it sounds impressive. -\_o<

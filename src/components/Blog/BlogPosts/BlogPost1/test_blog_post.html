		<h1>Metrics, or how we measure distance</h1>
		<h2>Rigorous Definition</h2>
		<p>So what is a metric? Let's start with the axiomatic definition, and build from there</p>

		From Wikipedia: 
		<blockquote>
		A metric on a set X is a function (called distance function or simply distance)

			d : X × X → [0, ∞)

		where [0, ∞) is the set of non-negative real numbers
		and for all x , y , z ∈ X the following three axioms are satisfied:
		<ol>
			<li><p>Identity of Indescernibles:</p> <p>d(x, y) = 0 ⇔ x = y</p></li>
			<li><p>Symmetry: </p><p>d(x, y) = d(y, x)</p></li>
			<li><p>Triangle Inequality: </p><p>d(x, y) ≤ d(x, z) + d(z, y)</p></li>
		</ol>
		</blockquote>
		<h2>What does this mean?</h2>
		<h3>It's Just a Function</h3>
		<p>
			So a metric is just a function. It take two inputs, probably the two points we want to
			know the distance between, and outputs a positive number between 0 and infinity.
			(Because we can't have negative distances, and we can't have infinity distances.)
			There are also 3 rules this function must follow!
		</p>
		<h3>Identity of Indescernibles</h3>
		<p>
			If two points are 0 distance apart, they are in fact the same point. Also, if two 
			points are equal, then they must be 0 distance apart
		</p>
		<h3>Symmetry</h3>
		<p>
			The distance from our first point to our second point must be equal to the distance 
			from our second point to our first point. Distance doesn't change when we swap the 
			direction we are going in
		</p>
		<h3>Triangle Inequality</h3>
		<p>
			If we are travelling from point A to point B, we have a certain distance between them.
			If we instead choose to take a detour and go from point A to point C and then from point C to
			point B, the distance must be greater than or equal to our original distance.
		</p>
		<h2>Euclidean distance / Straight-line distance</h2>
		<p>
			Euclidean distance is what most people think of when they think about measuring distance.
			It is called straight-line distance because you can imagine place a ruler between the two
			points and using that as the measure of distance.
			<br/>[PICTURE OF 2 BY 1 GRAPH]<br/>
			In the graph above, if we measure the length of the line between the points with a ruler, 
			we would get the euclidean distance. In this case, it is \sqrt{5}. How did we get this though?
			Well, we use our old friend a^2 + b^2 = c^2
			a^2 + b^2 = c^2 -> 1^2 + 2^2 = c^2 -> 5 = c^2 -> c = \sqrt{5}
			The general formula given two points A and B is:
			<blockquote>
				d(Point_1, Point_2) = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
			</blockquote>
		</p>
		<h2>A brief note on higher dimensions</h2>
		<p>
			We won't always be working in 2D. It is pretty common to need to find distances in 3D, 
			and we can actually extend the definition of a metric to higher dimensions. For the Euclidean
			distance, we get something like the following formula
			<blockquote>
				d(p,q) = \sqrt{\sum^n_{i=0} (p_i - q_i)^2}
			</blockquote>
			Now you can find the euclidean metric in an n-dimensional cartesian space. Is this helpful?
			Not sure, but it sounds impressive. -\_o< I will just work in 2 dimensions for now, but
			I will include the formulas for higher dimension metrics at the end :)
		</p>

		<h2>Visualizations</h2>
		<p>
			It can really help to get an intuitive feel for how these different metrics work. To
			accompany this post I've created two different toys you can play with. The first is a
			Voronoi Diagram found <a href="lemoncorp.xyz/Voronoi">here.</a> You can place points on
			the canvas, and it will color the rest of the canvas based on which point is closest to
			each pixel. The second is a Contour Map found <a href="lemoncorp.xyz/ContourLines">here.</a>
			Here, we draw a few rings around each point such that every point on the ring is the same distance
			from the point. You will often find this Contour Lines on maps to show elevation, where each point
			on the line is the same altitude. I highly recommend you play with these to get a feel for
			what these distances mean as you read this post. Just as a quick note, some of
			the distance options are not actually metrics. Are you able to figure out which ones are and
			which ones aren't?
		</p>
		<h2>Let's Explore Some Different Metrics</h2>
		<h3>Manhattan Distance</h3>
		<p>
			The Manhattan distance is the sum of the absolute values of the differences between the 
			coordinates of the two points.
			<blockquote>
				d(Point_1, Point_2) = |Point_2x - Point_1x| + |Point_2y - Point_1y|
				d(Point_1, Point_2) = \sum^n_{i=0} |p_i - q_i|
			</blockquote>
			You can imagine we were driving in a city with grids of streets. We couldn't drive straight
			to our destination, we would need to travel east or west, then travel north or south. Something
			like this.
			<br/>[PICTURE OF 2 BY 1 GRAPH]<br/>
			An interesting note, there are lots of paths we could take to get to our destination that are actually
			the shortest path.
			<br/>[PICTURE OF 2 BY 1 GRAPH]<br/>
			Here are three of the infinitely many possible examples. There are infinite paths because we don't 
			say each city block is 400 feet, 200 feet, or even 1 foot. Each city block is infinitesimally small.
			At each step of our journey we can move any amount in the X direction, or any amount in the Y direction,
			just as long as we are moving towards our point and not backtracking.
			<br/>[Contour Map]<br/>
			If you were playing with the visualizations, you might notice we get these diamonds when we place points.
			These make sense. Imagine we move straight up, we will get 1 unit away
			The lines are y = C - x, where C is the distance associated with that line. Let's say C = 1.
			So y = 1 -x, and we are aroudn point (0,0). Then, distance =
